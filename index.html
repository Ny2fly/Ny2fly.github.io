            <h3>Meet the CEO: NYA </h3>

            <p>Hello, You may know me as a web developer, Fashion model, Clothing designer,
                or your favorite emotional artist. However I simply like to refer to myself as a work of art that makes art!
                The BONKERZ brand was created by our CEO Nya. Before BONKERZ, you mightâ€™ve known her as your favorite fashion
                designer and go-to web developer for all your personal desires. However, her long-term goal has always been to
                create a community that not only possesses diverse creative qualities such as hers but also a community that
                can eventually live off of one another. And thus, BONKERZ was created.
            </p>
