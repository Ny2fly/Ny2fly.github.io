        <h2>NYA</h2>
<p>BONKERZ was created by our CEO Nya. Before BONKERZ, you mightâ€™ve known her as your favorite fashion designer and go to web developer for all your personal desires.
  However her longterm goal has always been to create a community that not only posesses diverse creatvie qualities such as hers, but also a community that can eventually 
  live off of one another. And thus, BONKERZ was created!  </p>
