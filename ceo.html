            <h2>NYA</h2>
            <p>BONKERZ was created by our CEO Nya. Before BONKERZ, you mightâ€™ve known her as your favorite fashion designer
                and go-to web developer for all your personal desires. However, her long-term goal has always been to create
                a community that not only possesses diverse creative qualities such as hers but also a community that can
                eventually live off of one another. And thus, BONKERZ was created!</p>
